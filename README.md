## Classic games
### By Javier Bullrich, the Game Bartender

This is a repository used to hold my project in which I'm trying to recreate classic games.

You may use, copy or do whatever you want with this code. There is no need to mention me or anything.

As I said before, I'm trying to recreate them, I'm still very inexperienced and so the code will be real buggy. Some games works, others are half made.

Currently the games that I made are:
- Arkanoid
- MineSweeper(really buggy)
- Pac-Man(in development)
- Snake(it still doesn't have the game over function)
- Tetris
